Creating an interactive using 32x32 LED Matrix painting for digital fabrication masters @ied madrid 

I am creating a IOT interactive painting that you can hang next to your door. When the painting senses motion, i.e someone exiting/entering the appartment it will display the Weather Information or snap a picture and use it as the initial state for Conway's Game of life. Where the idea is that life doesn't only happen to you. At some level you create it. You create it by using your senses. So your presence is essence in that experience.
