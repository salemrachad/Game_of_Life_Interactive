# Interactive_Painting
I am building an interactive painting for digital fabrication masters @ied madrid 

I am creating a IOT interactive painting that can hang next to your front door. When the painting senses motion, i.e someone exiting/entering the appartment it will display the Weather Information or snap a picture and use it as the initial state for Conway's Game of life. Where the idea is that life doesn't only happen to you. At some level you create it. So your presence is essence in that exchange.

I am going to be using a WS2812b as display. It has a good price, can connect multiple matrixes together and easily controlled by the fastLED or neopixel Library. Every LED on that requires 5 mA so make sure to do the correct calculations and chose the correct power supply.
